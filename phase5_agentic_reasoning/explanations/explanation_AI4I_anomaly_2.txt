**ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS REPORT**

**Anomaly ID**: AI4I_anomaly_2
**Analysis Date**: 2025-11-06 13:50:44

**EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**:
A high-severity anomaly (AI4I_anomaly_2) has been detected, characterized by abnormal power consumption, elevated torque, and deviations in rotational speed, indicating significant system stress and overload. The root cause has been determined to be a Mechanical System Failure, likely involving increased friction or degradation within the mechanical power train. Immediate remediation is recommended to prevent further damage and ensure operational integrity.

**DIAGNOSTIC FINDINGS**:
The system is exhibiting critical operational deviations, identified through a high reconstruction error of 0.2511, signifying a substantial departure from normal operating patterns.
*   **Symptoms**:
    *   Abnormal power consumption/output (likely elevated).
    *   Elevated torque, indicating increased load or resistance.
    *   Abnormal rotational speed (deviation from expected setpoint).
    *   System operating under significant stress or overload.
*   **Severity**: High
*   **Affected Equipment**: Motor, Mechanical System (e.g., bearings, shaft, gearbox, driven load), Drive/Controller.
*   **Confidence**: 0.90
*   **Reasoning**: The primary contributing features to this anomaly are 'power_estimate' and 'Torque [Nm]', which are significantly elevated. This pattern strongly suggests an increased mechanical load or resistance that the motor is attempting to overcome, leading to higher power draw and deviations in speed.

**ROOT CAUSE DETERMINATION**:
The root cause has been identified as a Mechanical System Failure, such as a bearing failure, gearbox issue, or increased friction within the mechanical train.
*   **Evidence**:
    *   **Symptom**: Elevated torque, directly indicating increased load or resistance within the mechanical system.
    *   **Affected Entity**: The Mechanical System (e.g., bearings, shaft, gearbox, driven load) is explicitly identified as an affected component, aligning with the observed torque increase.
    *   **Symptom**: Abnormal power consumption/output (likely elevated), which is a direct consequence of the motor working harder to overcome the increased mechanical resistance.
*   **Explanation**: The convergence of elevated torque, increased power consumption, and the identification of the mechanical system as the primary affected entity strongly points to a mechanical failure. This failure introduces additional resistance or load, forcing the motor to draw more power and generate higher torque to maintain operation, ultimately leading to system stress and speed deviations.

**CAUSAL CHAIN**:
Mechanical System Failure (e.g., seized bearing, worn gear) → Increased friction/resistance in mechanical system → Motor requires elevated torque to maintain operation → Motor draws abnormal power consumption/output → Rotational speed deviates from setpoint → System operates under significant stress/overload.

**REMEDIATION RECOMMENDATIONS**:
Based on the high severity and identified root cause, a comprehensive remediation plan is recommended to address the mechanical system failure.
*   **Actions**: A detailed remediation plan comprising 6 steps is recommended:
    1.  **Immediate System Shutdown**: Safely and promptly shut down the affected equipment to prevent further damage and ensure personnel safety.
    2.  **Detailed Mechanical Inspection**: Conduct a thorough physical inspection of all mechanical components, including bearings, gearbox, shaft, couplings, and the driven load, to pinpoint the exact source of increased friction or failure.
    3.  **Component Repair/Replacement**: Repair or replace any identified faulty mechanical components (e.g., worn bearings, damaged gears, misaligned shafts).
    4.  **Lubrication Verification**: Check and replenish lubrication levels for all relevant mechanical components to ensure optimal operating conditions.
    5.  **System Re-alignment and Calibration**: Ensure proper alignment of shafts and re-calibrate the drive system if components have been replaced or adjusted.
    6.  **Post-Repair Functional Testing**: Conduct comprehensive functional testing, including load tests and extended monitoring, to confirm the resolution of the anomaly and stable system operation.
*   **Timeline**: Overall estimated timeline: 10-20 hours (highly dependent on component availability, system complexity, and the specific nature of the mechanical failure).
*   **Priority**: High, given the significant stress on the system and the potential for catastrophic failure or extensive secondary damage if left unaddressed.

**CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT**:
*   **Diagnostic Confidence**: 0.90
*   **Root Cause Confidence**: 0.85
*   **Overall Confidence**: High. The diagnostic findings provide strong evidence, with a high reconstruction error and clear identification of elevated torque and power as top contributing features. This directly supports the conclusion of a mechanical system failure. While the exact mechanical component (e.g., specific bearing vs. gear) requires physical inspection, the overall classification of "Mechanical System Failure" as the root cause is robust and well-supported by the data.

**NEXT STEPS**:
*   **Immediate Action**: Initiate a controlled and safe shutdown of the affected equipment to mitigate further risk and prevent escalation of damage.
*   **Maintenance Coordination**: Engage maintenance and engineering teams to schedule and execute the detailed mechanical inspection as per the remediation plan.
*   **Parts Procurement**: Begin preliminary procurement or identification of potential replacement parts based on common failure modes in mechanical systems (e.g., bearings, seals, gearbox components).
*   **Enhanced Monitoring**: If safe and feasible, implement enhanced monitoring during the diagnostic phase to gather additional data points that could further refine the specific failure location.
*   **Documentation**: Document all findings, actions taken, and outcomes for future reference and continuous improvement.
