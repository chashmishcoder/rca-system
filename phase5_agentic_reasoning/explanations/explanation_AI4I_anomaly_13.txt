**ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS REPORT**

**Anomaly ID**: AI4I_anomaly_13
**Analysis Date**: 2025-11-06 15:48:57

**EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**:
A high-severity operational anomaly has been detected, characterized by significant deviation from normal machining parameters, excessive tool wear, and abnormal motor/spindle performance. The root cause has been identified as a Power Failure, leading to inconsistent power delivery and subsequent detrimental effects on the machining process. Immediate remediation is recommended to prevent further damage and operational disruption.

**DIAGNOSTIC FINDINGS**:
The system exhibited a high reconstruction error (0.2400), indicating a significant deviation from normal operating conditions. Key symptoms observed include:
*   **Significant deviation from normal operation**: Evidenced by the high reconstruction error.
*   **Excessive tool wear**: Identified as a top contributing feature (2.4815).
*   **Abnormal rotational speed**: Directly impacting spindle and cutting tool performance.
*   **Abnormal torque**: Indicative of issues with power delivery or load on the motor and spindle.

The severity of this anomaly is assessed as **high**. The affected equipment includes the Cutting Tool, Spindle, Motor, and the overall Machining Process. Diagnostic confidence is **0.88**, based on the clear identification of symptoms and their contribution to the anomaly.

**ROOT CAUSE DETERMINATION**:
The primary root cause for the observed anomaly has been determined to be a **Power Failure**. This determination is supported by:
*   **SWRL Rule MFG_R003 (Power Failure Rule)**: This rule directly links abnormal speed and torque readings to underlying power issues.
*   **Direct Symptom Correlation**: The symptoms 'Abnormal rotational speed' and 'Abnormal torque' are direct indicators of problems with the power delivery system to the motor or the motor's ability to maintain consistent output due to power fluctuations.
*   **Consequential Symptoms**: 'Excessive tool wear' is a common and expected consequence of improper cutting conditions, which directly result from inconsistent motor speed and torque caused by power issues.

**CAUSAL CHAIN**:
The progression from the root cause to the observed symptoms is as follows:
Power Failure → Inconsistent/Insufficient Power to Motor → Abnormal Motor Torque/Speed → Abnormal Spindle Rotational Speed & Torque → Improper Cutting Conditions → Excessive Tool Wear & Significant Deviation from Normal Operation

**REMEDIATION RECOMMENDATIONS**:
Based on the high severity of the anomaly, the following remediation actions are prioritized:
1.  **Immediate Power System Inspection**: Check main power supply, circuit breakers, and power cables for the affected machine.
2.  **Motor Power Supply Verification**: Inspect the motor's power connections, contactors, and variable frequency drive (VFD) or motor controller for faults or inconsistencies.
3.  **Motor Health Check**: Conduct a diagnostic check on the motor itself for signs of damage or overheating due to inconsistent power.
4.  **Spindle System Evaluation**: Assess the spindle for any damage or misalignment resulting from abnormal rotational speed and torque.
5.  **Tooling Inspection and Replacement**: Inspect the cutting tool for wear and replace if necessary, ensuring proper tool setup.
6.  **Process Parameter Recalibration**: Once power stability is confirmed, recalibrate machining parameters to optimal settings.

**Timeline**: Overall remediation is estimated to take 12-24 hours. This excludes potential long lead times for major component replacement (e.g., motor, VFD, spindle), which could extend the resolution time to several days.
**Priority**: High, due to the significant deviation from normal operation and potential for further equipment damage.

**CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT**:
The confidence in the identified root cause (Power Failure) is **0.65**. This confidence level is derived from the direct correlation of observed symptoms (abnormal speed and torque) with established rules and common industrial knowledge linking these to power delivery issues. While strong evidence points to power failure, further on-site verification of electrical systems will solidify this determination. The diagnostic confidence for identifying the symptoms and affected equipment remains high at 0.88.

**NEXT STEPS**:
1.  **Isolate and Secure**: Immediately isolate the affected machine from the power supply to prevent further damage.
2.  **Execute Remediation Plan**: Begin executing the prioritized remediation actions, starting with power system diagnostics.
3.  **Continuous Monitoring**: Implement enhanced monitoring of power input, motor performance, and spindle operation once repairs are complete and the machine is brought back online.
4.  **Post-Remediation Validation**: Conduct a comprehensive test run to ensure stable operation and adherence to normal parameters before resuming full production.
