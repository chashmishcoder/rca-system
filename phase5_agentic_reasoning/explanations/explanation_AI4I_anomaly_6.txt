**ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS REPORT**

**Anomaly ID**: AI4I_anomaly_6
**Analysis Date**: 2025-11-06 15:45:04

**EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**:
A high-severity anomaly has been detected, characterized by a significant deviation from the normal operating profile, including abnormal rotational speed, torque, and power consumption. The root cause has been determined to be a Power Failure, likely originating from a power supply issue or drive system malfunction, leading to unstable power delivery to the motor. Immediate remediation is required to restore normal operation and prevent further impact.

**DIAGNOSTIC FINDINGS**:
The system exhibited a significant deviation from its normal operating profile, evidenced by a high reconstruction error of 0.2578. Key symptoms observed include:
*   Abnormal rotational speed [rpm]
*   Abnormal torque
*   Abnormal power consumption/generation
The severity of this anomaly is assessed as high. The affected equipment spans critical components of the operational chain:
*   Motor
*   Drive System
*   Gearbox/Transmission
*   Spindle
*   Load/Process
The diagnostic confidence for these findings is high (0.90), primarily driven by the substantial deviation from learned normal patterns and the clear identification of 'Rotational speed [rpm]' as a top contributing feature.

**ROOT CAUSE DETERMINATION**:
The primary root cause for the observed anomaly has been identified as a **Power Failure**. This determination is strongly supported by the activation of SWRL Rule MFG_R003 (Power Failure Rule), which specifically triggered on the condition of 'low torque but rotational speed is high'. This rule match, combined with the observed symptoms of abnormal rotational speed, torque, and power consumption/generation across the Motor, Drive System, and downstream components, provides compelling evidence for insufficient or unstable power delivery. The confidence in this root cause determination is 0.85.

**CAUSAL CHAIN**:
The progression from the root cause to the observed symptoms is as follows:
1.  **Power Supply Issue** (e.g., voltage sag, phase loss) or **Drive System Malfunction** (Root Cause)
2.  **Insufficient/Unstable Power Delivery to Motor**
3.  **Motor unable to generate required torque** (low torque) and/or **Motor overspeeds** (high speed)
4.  **Abnormal Power Consumption/Generation**
5.  **Significant Deviation from Normal Operating Profile** (Observed Symptoms)

**REMEDIATION RECOMMENDATIONS**:
Given the high severity of this anomaly, immediate and prioritized actions are recommended:
*   **Actions**: A structured 6-step remediation plan should be initiated, focusing on diagnosing and rectifying the power failure. This typically includes:
    1.  Verify incoming power supply (voltage, phase, stability).
    2.  Inspect the Drive System for faults, error codes, or component failures.
    3.  Check motor connections and integrity.
    4.  Isolate and test individual components if necessary.
    5.  Repair or replace faulty power supply components or drive system modules.
    6.  Re-commission and test the system under load.
*   **Timeline**:
    *   **Immediate Diagnosis and Repair**: 4-8 hours (assuming parts availability).
    *   **Long-term Monitoring and PM Updates**: An additional 1-2 days for implementing enhanced monitoring protocols and updating preventative maintenance schedules to mitigate future occurrences.
*   **Priority**: High. This priority is assigned due to the significant operational impact indicated by the high severity rating and the critical nature of power delivery to the entire system.

**CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT**:
The overall confidence in this analysis is high. Diagnostic findings have a confidence of 0.90, supported by a high reconstruction error and clear feature contributions. The root cause determination has a confidence of 0.85, bolstered by the explicit match of a domain-specific rule (SWRL Rule MFG_R003) directly linking observed symptoms to a power failure scenario. The consistency between diagnostic symptoms, rule-based evidence, and the logical causal chain reinforces the validity of the identified root cause.

**NEXT STEPS**:
1.  **Immediate Action**: Initiate the recommended remediation plan without delay, focusing on the rapid diagnosis and repair of the power failure within the stipulated 4-8 hour timeframe.
2.  **Post-Repair Verification**: Thoroughly test the system after repair to ensure full restoration of normal operating parameters.
3.  **Enhanced Monitoring**: Implement long-term, continuous monitoring of power supply quality, drive system health, and motor performance.
4.  **PM Schedule Update**: Review and update preventative maintenance schedules to include more frequent checks or advanced diagnostics for power supply and drive system components to prevent recurrence.
