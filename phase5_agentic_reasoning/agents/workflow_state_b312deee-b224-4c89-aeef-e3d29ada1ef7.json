The top contributing features are 'Rotational speed [rpm]', 'Rotational speed [rpm]_normalized', 'power_estimate', 'Torque [Nm]_normalized', and 'Torque [Nm]'. The high contribution scores for these features mean they have deviated substantially from their expected values, driving the anomaly. Specifically:\n1.  **Rotational speed**: Has the highest contribution (6.3086), indicating a major abnormality in the machine's speed of rotation.\n2.  **Power estimate**: Has a significant contribution (2.2019), suggesting abnormal power consumption or output.\n3.  **Torque**: Also has a significant contribution (1.8675), pointing to an abnormal load or resistance.\n\nThe simultaneous and strong deviation of these three fundamental operational parameters (speed, torque, and power) suggests a critical issue affecting the machine's drive train, its load, or its control system. This is not a localized or minor anomaly but rather a systemic operational instability.",

  "final_explanation": "**ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS REPORT**\n\n**Anomaly ID**: AI4I_anomaly_1\n**Analysis Date**: 2025-11-06 13:49:40\n\n**EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**:\nThe drive system is experiencing high-severity operational instability, characterized by significant deviations in rotational speed, torque, and power estimates. Comprehensive analysis indicates that the primary root cause of this anomaly is a Power System Failure. Remediation efforts, prioritized as high, are recommended to address the underlying power supply and control issues.\n\n**DIAGNOSTIC FINDINGS**:\nThe system exhibits critical symptoms including significant deviation in rotational speed, torque, and power estimates, culminating in overall operational instability within the drive system. The severity of these symptoms is assessed as high.\nAffected equipment spans across the Motor, Drive Train (including gearbox, couplings, and bearings), the Load, the Control System (motor controller, speed regulator), and the Power Supply.\nDiagnostic confidence is high (0.90), supported by a high reconstruction error (0.4397) which signifies a substantial departure from normal operating parameters. The top contributing features to this anomaly are directly related to 'Rotational speed'.\n\n**ROOT CAUSE DETERMINATION**:\nThe root cause has been determined to be a Power System Failure. This conclusion is supported by multiple lines of evidence:\n*   An SWRL Rule (MFG_R003) directly links observed torque and speed deviations to a 'Power Failure' with a confidence of 0.333.\n*   The identified affected entities include both the 'Power Supply' and the 'Control System', which are integral components of the power delivery architecture.\n*   The current anomaly shows a high similarity (0.947) to historical case AI4I_anomaly_24, a known failure pattern frequently associated with power or control-related issues.\n\n**CAUSAL CHAIN**:\nThe progression from the root cause to the observed symptoms is as follows:\nPower Supply/Control System Issue (e.g., voltage sag, current fluctuation, faulty speed regulator) \u2192 Inconsistent or incorrect power delivery to Motor \u2192 Significant deviation in rotational speed, torque, and power estimate \u2192 Operational instability in the drive system.\n\n**REMEDIATION RECOMMENDATIONS**:\nA comprehensive remediation plan, comprising 6 distinct steps (ACT-001 to ACT-006), has been outlined to address the identified Power System Failure.\n*   **Actions**: Implement the 6 defined steps (ACT-001 to ACT-006) to diagnose, repair, and stabilize the power supply and control system.\n*   **Timeline**: The initial five remediation actions (ACT-001 to ACT-005) are estimated to be completed within 1-2 business days. Ongoing monitoring and the implementation of ACT-006 are projected to take 1-2 weeks.\n*   **Priority**: High, due to the severe operational instability and potential for further damage or downtime.\n\n**CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT**:\nThe confidence in the diagnostic findings is 0.90, indicating a strong certainty in the observed symptoms and affected systems. The confidence in the identified root cause (Power System Failure) is 0.75, supported by corroborating evidence from rule-based systems, affected entities, and historical pattern matching. Overall, there is substantial confidence in both the diagnosis and the determined root cause, providing a solid foundation for the recommended remediation.\n\n**NEXT STEPS**:\n*   Immediately initiate the first five remediation actions (ACT-001 to ACT-005) to address the Power System Failure, aiming for completion within 1-2 business days.\n*   Establish and maintain ongoing monitoring of the drive system's power supply parameters, control system outputs, and overall operational stability.\n*   Implement ACT-006, focusing on long-term stability and preventative measures, over the next 1-2 weeks."
