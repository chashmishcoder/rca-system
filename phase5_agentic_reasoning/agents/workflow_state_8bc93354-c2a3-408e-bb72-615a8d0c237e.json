The top contributing features are 'power_estimate', 'Torque [Nm]', and 'Rotational speed [rpm]', all showing high deviation scores. The highest contributor is 'power_estimate' (1.6883), followed closely by 'Torque [Nm]' (1.5430). 'Rotational speed [rpm]' also shows a notable contribution (1.2165). This combination strongly suggests that the system is experiencing an increased load or resistance. Elevated torque typically indicates the machine is working harder against resistance, which in turn would require more power. The rotational speed deviation could be a consequence of the increased load (e.g., struggling to maintain speed, or overcompensating). Without specific values, we infer that these deviations are likely increases, as this is a common failure mode for these parameters under stress. The simultaneous high deviation in these core operational parameters points to significant operational stress.",

  "reasoning_confidence": 0.85,
  "reasoning_steps": "Thought 1: The symptoms indicate a severe operational issue characterized by excessive energy demand, mechanical strain, and speed deviation. The core problem appears to be an increased load or resistance within the system. All three affected entities (Motor, Mechanical System, Drive/Controller) are interconnected and could be either a cause or a consequence of this increased load.\n\nObservation 1: The Knowledge Graph context provided no direct causal paths for the affected entities, indicating a lack of specific, pre-defined relationships in this particular query. The SWRL rules were largely unhelpful: MFG_R002 (Heat Dissipation Failure) requires temperature data not present in the symptoms, making it inapplicable. MFG_R003 (Power Failure) explicitly states 'low torque but rotational speed is high', which directly contradicts the observed symptom of 'Elevated torque'. Therefore, neither rule provides actionable insight for this specific set of symptoms. However, the similar historical cases (AI4I_anomaly_9, AI4I_anomaly_24, AI4I_anomaly_11) show high similarity (0.92, 0.90, 0.83) for these symptoms, suggesting a common failure pattern, although their specific root causes are not provided in this snippet.\n\nThought 2: Based on the symptoms, particularly 'Elevated torque, indicating increased load or resistance', the most direct causal hypotheses relate to either a physical impediment (mechanical failure) or the motor struggling against an internal or external force. A drive/controller malfunction could also be a cause, but it's less directly implied by the 'increased load or resistance' aspect.\n\nObservation 2: \n- **Mechanical System Failure**: This hypothesis directly explains 'Elevated torque, indicating increased load or resistance'. If a component like a bearing or gearbox fails, it introduces friction, requiring the motor to exert more torque, consuming more power, and leading to speed deviation and overall system stress. This aligns perfectly with the symptoms and the 'Mechanical System' affected entity.\n- **Motor Overload/Internal Failure**: An internal motor fault (e.g., winding short, partial seizure) or an external overload could cause the motor to draw excessive power, generate high torque, and fail to maintain speed. This explains all symptoms and involves the 'Motor' entity. However, 'increased load or resistance' often points to the mechanical system as the *initial* source of the problem, with the motor reacting to it.\n- **Drive/Controller Malfunction**: A faulty drive or controller could issue incorrect commands, leading to the motor attempting to produce excessive torque or failing to regulate speed properly. This would result in abnormal power consumption and speed. While possible, the explicit mention of 'increased load or resistance' makes this a slightly less direct explanation for the *source* of the resistance, though it could be the cause of the motor *trying* to overcome it.\n\nThought 3: Ranking hypotheses by likelihood:\n1.  **Mechanical System Failure**: This is the strongest hypothesis because the symptom 'Elevated torque, indicating increased load or resistance' directly points to a physical impediment or increased friction within the mechanical train. This would naturally lead to the motor drawing more power, struggling with speed, and the entire system being under stress. The high diagnostic confidence (0.9) supports a clear, identifiable issue.\n2.  **Motor Overload/Internal Failure**: This is a strong contender. An internal motor fault could independently cause these symptoms. However, it's also a common consequence of a mechanical system failure. Without further data to distinguish, it remains highly plausible as a primary root cause.\n3.  **Drive/Controller Malfunction**: While the drive/controller is an affected entity and could cause speed and power issues, it's less directly implicated by the 'increased load or resistance' aspect of the elevated torque. A controller might *command* high torque, but the *resistance* implies a physical opposition, which is more characteristic of a mechanical or motor internal issue. It's a possible cause but less likely to be the *initial* source of the 'resistance'.",

  "final_explanation": "**ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS REPORT**\n\n**Anomaly ID**: AI4I_anomaly_2\n**Analysis Date**: 2025-11-06 13:50:44\n\n**EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**:\nA high-severity anomaly (AI4I_anomaly_2) has been detected, characterized by abnormal power consumption, elevated torque, and deviations in rotational speed, indicating significant system stress and overload. The root cause has been determined to be a Mechanical System Failure, likely involving increased friction or degradation within the mechanical power train. Immediate remediation is recommended to prevent further damage and ensure operational integrity.\n\n**DIAGNOSTIC FINDINGS**:\nThe system is exhibiting critical operational deviations, identified through a high reconstruction error of 0.2511, signifying a substantial departure from normal operating patterns.\n*   **Symptoms**:\n    *   Abnormal power consumption/output (likely elevated).\n    *   Elevated torque, indicating increased load or resistance.\n    *   Abnormal rotational speed (deviation from expected setpoint).\n    *   System operating under significant stress or overload.\n*   **Severity**: High\n*   **Affected Equipment**: Motor, Mechanical System (e.g., bearings, shaft, gearbox, driven load), Drive/Controller.\n*   **Confidence**: 0.90\n*   **Reasoning**: The primary contributing features to this anomaly are 'power_estimate' and 'Torque [Nm]', which are significantly elevated. This pattern strongly suggests an increased mechanical load or resistance that the motor is attempting to overcome, leading to higher power draw and deviations in speed.\n\n**ROOT CAUSE DETERMINATION**:\nThe root cause has been identified as a Mechanical System Failure, such as a bearing failure, gearbox issue, or increased friction within the mechanical train.\n*   **Evidence**:\n    *   **Symptom**: Elevated torque, directly indicating increased load or resistance within the mechanical system.\n    *   **Affected Entity**: The Mechanical System (e.g., bearings, shaft, gearbox, driven load) is explicitly identified as an affected component, aligning with the observed torque increase.\n    *   **Symptom**: Abnormal power consumption/output (likely elevated), which is a direct consequence of the motor working harder to overcome the increased mechanical resistance.\n*   **Explanation**: The convergence of elevated torque, increased power consumption, and the identification of the mechanical system as the primary affected entity strongly points to a mechanical failure. This failure introduces additional resistance or load, forcing the motor to draw more power and generate higher torque to maintain operation, ultimately leading to system stress and speed deviations.\n\n**CAUSAL CHAIN**:\nMechanical System Failure (e.g., seized bearing, worn gear) \u2192 Increased friction/resistance in mechanical system \u2192 Motor requires elevated torque to maintain operation \u2192 Motor draws abnormal power consumption/output \u2192 Rotational speed deviates from setpoint \u2192 System operates under significant stress/overload.\n\n**REMEDIATION RECOMMENDATIONS**:\nBased on the high severity and identified root cause, a comprehensive remediation plan is recommended to address the mechanical system failure.\n*   **Actions**: A detailed remediation plan comprising 6 steps is recommended:\n    1.  **Immediate System Shutdown**: Safely and promptly shut down the affected equipment to prevent further damage and ensure personnel safety.\n    2.  **Detailed Mechanical Inspection**: Conduct a thorough physical inspection of all mechanical components, including bearings, gearbox, shaft, couplings, and the driven load, to pinpoint the exact source of increased friction or failure.\n    3.  **Component Repair/Replacement**: Repair or replace any identified faulty mechanical components (e.g., worn bearings, damaged gears, misaligned shafts).\n    4.  **Lubrication Verification**: Check and replenish lubrication levels for all relevant mechanical components to ensure optimal operating conditions.\n    5.  **System Re-alignment and Calibration**: Ensure proper alignment of shafts and re-calibrate the drive system if components have been replaced or adjusted.\n    6.  **Post-Repair Functional Testing**: Conduct comprehensive functional testing, including load tests and extended monitoring, to confirm the resolution of the anomaly and stable system operation.\n*   **Timeline**: Overall estimated timeline: 10-20 hours (highly dependent on component availability, system complexity, and the specific nature of the mechanical failure).\n*   **Priority**: High, given the significant stress on the system and the potential for catastrophic failure or extensive secondary damage if left unaddressed.\n\n**CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT**:\n*   **Diagnostic Confidence**: 0.90\n*   **Root Cause Confidence**: 0.85\n*   **Overall Confidence**: High. The diagnostic findings provide strong evidence, with a high reconstruction error and clear identification of elevated torque and power as top contributing features. This directly supports the conclusion of a mechanical system failure. While the exact mechanical component (e.g., specific bearing vs. gear) requires physical inspection, the overall classification of \"Mechanical System Failure\" as the root cause is robust and well-supported by the data.\n\n**NEXT STEPS**:\n*   **Immediate Action**: Initiate a controlled and safe shutdown of the affected equipment to mitigate further risk and prevent escalation of damage.\n*   **Maintenance Coordination**: Engage maintenance and engineering teams to schedule and execute the detailed mechanical inspection as per the remediation plan.\n*   **Parts Procurement**: Begin preliminary procurement or identification of potential replacement parts based on common failure modes in mechanical systems (e.g., bearings, seals, gearbox components).\n*   **Enhanced Monitoring**: If safe and feasible, implement enhanced monitoring during the diagnostic phase to gather additional data points that could further refine the specific failure location.\n*   **Documentation**: Document all findings, actions taken, and outcomes for future reference and continuous improvement."
