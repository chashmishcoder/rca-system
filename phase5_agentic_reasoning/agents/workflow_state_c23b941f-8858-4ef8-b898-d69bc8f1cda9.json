  "diagnostic_reasoning": "The anomaly is characterized by a high reconstruction error (0.1583), indicating a significant deviation from normal operating patterns. The top contributing features are Torque, Rotational Speed, and estimated Power, all showing significantly elevated values (normalized values > 1.4 for Torque and Rotational Speed, and > 1.1 for Power). This combination suggests the machine is operating under an abnormally high load or at an unusually high intensity. High torque indicates increased resistance or load, while high rotational speed indicates the motor is running faster than usual. The resulting high power estimate confirms that the machine is consuming or delivering significantly more energy than typical. This state is not merely a high torque with low speed (like a jam) or low torque with high speed (like an unloaded motor), but rather a simultaneous elevation of both, pointing to an extreme operational condition that could lead to accelerated wear, overheating, or mechanical stress.",

This load could originate from the external process (e.g., material properties, tooling issues, process parameters) or from increased internal resistance within the mechanical drivetrain (e.g., friction, binding). The motor and drive system respond by increasing torque and speed to overcome this resistance or meet the demand, leading to elevated power consumption and operation under an intense, overloaded state."

This means the KG does not provide direct causal links for these entities in this specific context, limiting direct ontological guidance.\n- **SWRL Rules Matched**: \n  - `MFG_R002: Heat Dissipation Failure Rule`: Requires process and air temperature data, which is not provided. Thus, this rule cannot be directly applied to determine a root cause, although heat generation is a likely *consequence* of the observed symptoms.\n  - `MFG_R003: Power Failure Rule`: Conditions ('torque is low' and 'rotational speed is high') are directly contradicted by the symptoms ('Abnormally high torque' and 'Abnormally high rotational speed'). Therefore, this rule is not applicable.\n- **Similar Historical Cases**: Three highly similar cases (`AI4I_anomaly_13`, `AI4I_anomaly_2`, `AI4I_anomaly_4`) are found with similarity scores above 0.86. This confirms that this specific pattern of symptoms has occurred before.

I will consider different origins for this excessive load.\n\nPossible root causes:\n1.  **Excessive Load/Process Demand**: The external process or material being worked on requires more effort than usual.\n2.  **Mechanical Friction/Binding**: Internal resistance within the drivetrain components (bearings, gearbox, spindle) due to wear, misalignment, or failure.\n3.  **Control System Malfunction**: The control system is commanding excessively high torque and speed, leading to the observed output.\n\nI will evaluate how well each hypothesis explains all symptoms and consider the strength of the evidence."

'Operation under excessive load/intensity' is a direct match. High torque, high speed, and elevated power consumption are all direct consequences of the system trying to overcome an increased external load. This is a very strong explanation.\n- **Hypothesis 2 (Mechanical Friction/Binding)**: This is a specific type of 'excessive load' where the resistance is internal to the machine. It also directly explains all symptoms, as the motor would need to generate more torque and consume more power to overcome this internal friction and maintain speed. Affected entities like Bearings, Gearbox, Spindle are consistent with this.\n- **Hypothesis 3 (Control System Malfunction)**: While a control system could command high speed and power, the presence of 'Abnormally high torque' usually implies that the motor is actually working against a significant resistance. If the load isn't physically present, a control system malfunction might lead to high speed and power, but not necessarily sustained high torque. Therefore, this is a less complete explanation for *all* symptoms, especially high torque, unless it's commanding the system to push against an actual (even if unintended) load.\n\nNeither SWRL rules nor KG context provide direct confirmatory evidence for any specific root cause, but the symptoms themselves are very strong indicators of an overload condition."

  "final_explanation": "**ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS REPORT**\n\n**Anomaly ID**: AI4I_anomaly_4\n**Analysis Date**: 2025-11-06 13:51:56\n\n**EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**:\nAn anomaly characterized by abnormally high torque, rotational speed, and elevated power consumption has been detected, indicating operation under excessive load/intensity. The root cause has been determined to be an Excessive Load Condition, stemming from either external process demands or internal mechanical resistance. This high-severity issue requires immediate investigation and remediation to prevent potential equipment damage and operational failure.\n\n**DIAGNOSTIC FINDINGS**:\nThe system is exhibiting critical symptoms including Abnormally high torque, Abnormally high rotational speed, Elevated power consumption/output, and Operation under excessive load/intensity. These symptoms are indicative of a significant deviation from normal operating parameters, with a high reconstruction error of 0.1583. The primary affected components include the Motor, Drive System, Gearbox, Bearings, Spindle, and the Load/Process itself. The diagnostic confidence for these findings is 0.90.\n\n**ROOT CAUSE DETERMINATION**:\nBased on the observed symptoms, the root cause has been identified as an **Excessive Load Condition**. This determination is strongly supported by direct evidence:\n*   **Operation under excessive load/intensity**: This symptom is a direct observation confirming the presence of an overload situation.\n*   **Abnormally high torque**: Elevated torque values directly indicate increased resistance that the system is attempting to overcome.\n*   **Abnormally high rotational speed**: This suggests the motor/drive system is working harder to maintain desired speed against the increased resistance, or is being over-driven in an attempt to compensate for the load.\nThe confluence of these symptoms points unequivocally to an external or internal factor imposing excessive demand on the system.\n\n**CAUSAL CHAIN**:\nThe progression from the root cause to the observed symptoms is as follows:\nExcessive Load Condition (e.g., harder material, dull tooling, process blockage, or increased internal friction/binding)\n\u2192 Increased resistance on Spindle/Load/Drivetrain\n\u2192 Motor/Drive System increases Torque & Speed to overcome resistance/meet demand\n\u2192 Elevated Power Consumption/Output\n\u2192 Operation under excessive load/intensity\n\n**REMEDIATION RECOMMENDATIONS**:\nA comprehensive remediation plan consisting of 6 distinct steps is recommended to address the Excessive Load Condition. Given the high severity of the anomaly, these actions are prioritized as critical. The overall estimated timeline for resolution is 10-24 hours, though this is highly dependent on the availability of necessary parts and the complexity of any required mechanical repairs. Specific actions will focus on identifying and alleviating the source of the excessive load, whether it's process-related (e.g., material properties, tooling condition, blockages) or mechanical (e.g., bearing friction, gearbox issues, spindle binding).\n\n**CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT**:\nThe overall confidence in this Root Cause Analysis is high, at 0.95. This is supported by the strong diagnostic confidence (0.90) and the direct correlation between the identified root cause and all observed symptoms. The evidence provides a clear and consistent explanation for the anomaly.\n\n**NEXT STEPS**:\n1.  **Immediate Action**: Halt operation or reduce load to a safe level if possible, to prevent further damage.\n2.  **Detailed Investigation**: Commence immediate investigation into the specific source of the Excessive Load Condition. This includes inspecting the process (material, tooling, flow) and mechanical components (bearings, gearbox, spindle for friction or binding).\n3.  **Execute Remediation Plan**: Implement the 6-step remediation plan once the specific cause of the excessive load is identified.\n4.  **Monitoring**: Closely monitor Torque, Rotational Speed, and Power Consumption during and after remediation to confirm resolution and prevent recurrence."
