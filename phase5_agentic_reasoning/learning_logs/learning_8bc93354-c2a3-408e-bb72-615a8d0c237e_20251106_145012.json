This rule should trigger a sub-analysis for component-level identification.",

      "description": "Improve the action generation process to be more specific and efficient. This includes: 1) Generating remediation actions directly tied to the most specific identified root cause. 2) Implementing a redundancy check to prune actions that are either covered by more specific actions or explicitly found 'not needed' during the diagnostic process (e.g., 'lubrication replenishment not needed' should remove 'lubrication replenishment' from the plan).",

  "feedback_summary": "The diagnostic system correctly identified the general category of the root cause (Mechanical System Failure) but failed to pinpoint the specific component (thrust bearing). The reasoning process was partially correct due to this lack of specificity. The remediation plan was partially effective, containing redundant actions, indicating that a more precise root cause would lead to a more optimized plan. The overall confidence was high, but the partial correctness in reasoning and planning suggests a need for calibration."
